# 📊 Applied Data Science with Python – Capstone Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my capstone project for **Applied Data Science with Python**.  
The goal of the project was to explore a dataset, perform **univariate and bivariate statistical analysis**, and build clear visualizations that tell a meaningful story about the data.

The notebook walks through the process step by step:
- Understanding the **shape of the data** (distribution, skewness, outliers).
- Applying **measures of central tendency** (mean, median, mode).
- Comparing **relationships between variables** using grouped summaries and charts.
- Building **visualizations** (bar charts, grouped bars, stacked bars, etc.) to highlight differences across regions and categories.
- Reflecting on the process of data storytelling and how to simplify complex datasets for an audience.

## 📂 Contents
- `AppliedDataScienceWithPython.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and visualizations.
- Data source: CSV file provided as part of the capstone (loaded directly in the notebook).
- Outputs: Tables and charts showing distributions, regional comparisons, and categorical breakdowns.

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- How to perform **univariate analysis** to understand one variable at a time.
- How to interpret **categorical vs. numerical data types** (nominal, ordinal, discrete, continuous).
- How to handle **outliers** and decide when they add meaning or distract from the story.
- How to use **pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib** to create beginner‑friendly, reproducible visualizations.
- The importance of **storytelling in data science**: knowing your audience and presenting insights step by step.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **numpy** and **scipy** for statistical calculations
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualization

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jishdewanjee/CapStone3.git

## ✨ Reflection
This capstone helped me move from confusion about data types and statistical terms to a clearer understanding through hands‑on practice. By working directly with the CSV file and building charts, I learned how to identify distributions, compare regions, and simplify insights for storytelling. While there’s still more to learn, this project gave me confidence in approaching datasets and presenting them in a structured, audience‑friendly way.

## 📈 Future Work
- Extend analysis with regression models or predictive techniques.
- Explore multivariate analysis to uncover deeper relationships.
- Build more advanced interactive visualizations for storytelling.
